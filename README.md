# Library Management System

This project is a web-based application designed to help libraries efficiently manage their resources and streamline operations.

## How to Run?
### Prerequisites
- Install MySQL Workbench or MySQL.

### Steps to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench or a terminal.
2. If using a terminal, set the path to the MySQL bin directory.
   For example:
   cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.3\bin
4. Log in to MySQL using the following command:
   mysql -u username -p
   Replace `username` with your MySQL username. You will be prompted to enter your password.
5. Once logged in, paste the schema of the library management system (provided in the zip file) into the MySQL terminal to create the database.
6. To confirm that the database was created successfully, run the following command:
   show databases;
   This will display a list of all databases, including the one for the library management system.

Now you're ready to use the library management system.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to adjust the path to the MySQL bin directory according to your installation.
